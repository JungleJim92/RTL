This project was created for the class EE 460R VLSI at UT by James Schulman, Brandon Boesch, and Josh Randall. It implements a full Verilog implementation of a UART module, consistent with the UART standard. The project contains all Verilog code used for the design and verification. There is also an IEEE formatted document detailing the design.
